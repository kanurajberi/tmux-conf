# tmux-conf
The configuration file for my tmux.
# Major Changes
Only basic changes have been made:    
* 256-bit color has been enabled.    
* CTRL-b has been replaced by CTRL-a.    
* Split commands have been changed to '|' and '-', as they are more descriptive.    
* Pane Switching is now possible with ALT-Arrow as well as VIM directional keys (h,j,k,l).    
* Design has been improved a lot.
